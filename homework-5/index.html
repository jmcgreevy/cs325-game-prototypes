<h2>Shock</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a shooter but it's 2D which is rarely done, I want to try and implement multiple/online play into it so that's another form of originality aswell.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There will be multiplayer in future iterations, but for now just the trigonometry required to perform the rotation calculations for the aiming.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This assignment taught me a lot of the limitations of Phaser, originally I wanted to implement the camera moving with the mouse rotation (as if the player was always facing forward) but there is no way to get canvas coordinates and every coordinate is relative to phaser's camera, so as the camera rotated with the mouse the (x, y) positions would always update causing an infinite spinning effect.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Button Press Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Nightflame/sounds/397599/">Menu FX 02</a></li>
<li>Pistol Shoot Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/LeMudCrab/sounds/163456/">Pistol Shot</a></li>
<li>Block sprite: Created by me</li>
<li>Tilemap: Created by me</li>
<li>Tileset: Created by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Counter-Strike mixed with a shoot-em up game (Due to POV), you can also equate this to a 2D overhead Quake.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're a competitor in a tournament where people are selected at random to either fight each other or compete through levels of enemies armed with guns.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme of a dystopian future.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being prototyped is the rotational aiming, movement mechanics, and fundamental gameplay (In future iterations it will be multiplayer and refinement).
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should have a fast-paced and exhilarating experience where matches/levels are short but "sweet".
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player should move by using WASD, aim/look with the mouse, possibly run with SHIFT (future iterations), and possibly jump/roll with SPACE (future iterations). You'll have a (future iterations) online options where you face off against others in a server in a deathmatch and possibly team-deathmatch gamemode.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategies include hiding behind walls and "peeking" when shooting to maximize the cover you get when fighting. Another strategy is the run and gun strategy where you run fast across the map while gunning down your foes.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world setting is a dystopian future with the world led by one single evil corporation that kidnaps people to put through tournaments such as deathmatches and team-deathmatches. (Story is more of an afterthought, I want to focus more on gameplay and refinement similar to games like Doom, Quake, and Counter-Strike).
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target-audience this is trying to reach is teenagers and young adults interested in shooters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Each round would take approximately 5-10 minutes, the matches will be continuous and infinite.
</li>
