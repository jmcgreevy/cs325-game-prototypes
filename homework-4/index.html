<h2>A Murder Most Fowl</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? <br>
It's a murder mystery starring chickens. Other than that naturally being an easy way to make a punny title, I think conceptually its funny enough to get a chuckle out of some people. And I thought it was pretty clever that the culprit was actually the unassuming dog.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? <br> 
As per the mandated variety, I decided to make a text-based game since my other games didn't have such mechanics. Unfortunately there's not too much that's interesting about just a text game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? <br> 
I originally wanted to play around with the text options but I was having trouble getting anything to work. As it stands now, all the text is actually part of the backgrounds when the states are loaded in. If i was able to get text working properly, that could've opened the doors for randomization of clues and murder suspects (if I had enough chicken art)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of the art I made myself<br>
The music I used (called Possession) is from here:
<li>

</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Its similar to any other text-based point and click game, although I wrote all the code myself based off of the state examples.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
As Detective Cluck, your job is to pick amongst the suspects from your list of clues, in order to make sure evil-dooers are punished.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.<br>
I used the "chicken" storymatic theme. If I had more time to write, I could've also tied it in with "revenge."
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
The genre and input is a point and click text-game. The game itself is a whodunnit but because there's no randomness, it is missing replay value.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
This game is completely controlled from the mouse, with no other imputs. Unlike my other games that used WASD or the arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
While its only a simple text game, I think players would have a chuckle given my dialogue and the reasonings behind each suspect.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In order to make sure the right suspect pays for their crimes, you must use deductive reasoning in order to identify who was the murderer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
The game is pretty forgiving and there aren't a lot of options, so anyone would be able to win given enough time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are Detective Cluck, a chicken who solves murder mysteries. It's your job to make sure the right chicken gets sent to jail.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like "whodunnit" mystery games. Or just puzzles in general.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br>
The game is pretty short, even if you pick all the wrong options. From start to finish, its about 1-2 minutes depending on how fast you can read.
</li>
